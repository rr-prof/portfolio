            <p>Let me introduce myself</p>
            <p>Hi, I'm Ryu. I am a creator</p>
            <p>After graduating from a Japanese university (major in precision mechanical engineering), I worked as a software engineer in Tokyo,Japan, then went to Vancouver, Canada for English study, and is currently studying digital marketing at a college in Vancouver.
            <br>My primary languages include Java, SQL Server, Oracle SQL, TypeScript, and Vue.js.
            </p>
            <p>My career may seem inconsistent, but I have never lost my focus on    creating things.
            Whether it is software or hardware, the joy of creating something is immeasurable.
            As a creator, I will continue to search for and provide exciting things.
           </p>
